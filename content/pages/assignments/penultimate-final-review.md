Penultimate — Develop & Build
-----------------------------

Students are required to present their final project proposals. They are asked to discuss the technical possibilities and needs for the project’s realization and not less important – project documentation. We will have [Madeleine Gallagher](http://act.mit.edu/people/staff/madeleine-gallagher/) (ACT media associate) in the class responsible for the technical assistance and equipment.

_Due date: Session 22_

Final Review — Present
----------------------

Students will have to complete the lifecycle of a project from conception to design/construction, to articulate an artist's statement and formulate a visually and spatially compelling presentation strategy.

_Requirements:_

*   Students are required to make a presentation (up to 15 min.) about their project and offer a constructive and coherent feedback to the reviewer's comments.
*   Students are required to upload full documentation of their project on the class blog (production process, final project).

_Due date: Session 26_
